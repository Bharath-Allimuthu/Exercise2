            <h3>biogas</h3> 
            <p>Biogas is an environmentally-friendly, renewable energy source produced by the breakdown of organic matter such as food scraps and animal waste. Find out how biogas is produced and how it can be used to Organic Fertilizers, fuel vehicles, heat our homes and to generate electricity.</p>   
    </div>

    <div class="biogas-produce">
        <h3>biogas production procedure</h3>
        <p>Biogas a renewable fuel that's produced when organic matter, such as food or animal waste, is broken down by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen. This process is called anaerobic digestion. For this to take place, the waste material needs to be enclosed in an environment where there is no oxygen. Biogas can occur naturally or as part of an industrial process to intentionally create it as a fuel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="energy-source">
        <h3>biogas beneficial as an energy source</h3>
        <p>The biological matter that’s used to produce biogas will naturally decay anyway, so capturing the gases produced by this decay, and using them as an energy source, causes less harm to the environment than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere.</p>
        <P>The process of producing biogas is also largely cyclical and fits into an overall sustainable cycle of managing agricultural waste. For example, animal waste produced on a farm can be used to produce biogas, which can then be used to fuel the farm machinery.</P>
    </div>

    <div class="sort-of-waste">
        <h3>sort of waste can be used to produce biogas</h3>
        <p>A wide variety of waste material breaks down into biogas, including animal manure, municipal rubbish or waste, plant material, food waste or sewage.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="gases">
        <h3>gases contain in biogas</h3>
        <p>Biogas consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide. It can also include small amounts of hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes and some moisture. The relative quantities of these vary depending on the type of waste involved in the production of the resulting biogas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="uses">
        <h3>biogas used for</h3>
        <p>To fuel vehicles – if biogas is compressed it can be used as a vehicle fuel.</p>
        <p>As a replacement for natural gas – if biogas is cleaned up and upgraded to natural gas standards, it’s then known as biomethane and can be used in a similar way to methane; this can include for cooking and heating.</p>
        <p>To Organic Fertilizers - after segregation it can be used as environment friendly Fertilizers</p>
        <p>Electricity - if we use massive we can generate power to recover energy and supply  between 65% and 70% of their own electric demand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advantage">
        <h3>advantages of biogas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Biogas is a green energy source in form of electricity and heat for the local grid.</li>
            <li>Considerable environmental advantages - less emission of the greenhouse gasses methane, CO2 and nitrous oxide.</li>
            <li>Environmentally friendly recirculation of organic waste from industry and households.</li>
            <li>Less odour inconveniences when spreading slurry on the fields - fermented slurry smells considerably less than normal slurry and the smell decreases faster.</li>
            <li>Plants absorb fermented slurry better, increasing the yield on the fields.</li>
            <li>Protection of subsoil water - improved nitrogen exploitation reduces leaching and thereby drinking water contamination.</li>
            <li> Reduced costs for artifical fertilizer.</li>
